## Overview
This is a tutorial for LoopBack 4 that will show you how to get started creating LoopBack 4 Applications. This will be presented at CASCON 2017. The application we'll be creating is a simple Diary application to write your daily thoughts but we'll get a tone analysis from [Watson Tone Analyzer](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/tone-analyzer/) for each diary entry to understand your mood and to be able to search for entries by mood.
